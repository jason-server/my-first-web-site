<h2>CSS</h2>
<p> CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996 for a rather 
    simple reason. HTML element was not designed to have tags that would help 
    format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the web page.
Tags like <font> were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of 
    trouble for web developers. Due to the fact that web pages have different fonts, 
    colored backgrounds, and multiple styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive 
    process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.
    
    CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldnâ€™t want to look at a 
    web page that features only HTML elements as it would look completely bare-boned.
