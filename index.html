<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The Web (short for World Wide Web) is a hypertext-based 
    global information system that was originally developed
     at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in 
     Geneva. It is a subset of the Internet, technically
      defined as the community on the Internet where all 
      documents and resources are formatted using Hypertext 
      Markup Language (HTML). HTML, and the related Hypertext
       Transport Protocol (HTTP), make it easy to find and 
       view data and documents stored on computers connected 
       to the Internet. HTML creates the links (“hyperlinks”) 
       that enable the user to move among many Web documents 
       with the click of a mouse.
